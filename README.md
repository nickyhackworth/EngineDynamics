# EngineDynamics
ME 369P Final Project - 4-Stroke Cycle Simulation, Animation, and Kinematic Analysis

## 1. Objective
Model the basic dynamics of an ideal 4-stroke cycle piston assembly, and animate a single piston assembly

## 2. Requirements
- Define and implement forcing function
- Derive EOM for single piston assembly
- Plot torque and angular velocity about crankshaft

## 3. How to use: 4_stroke_simulation.py

## 4. How to use: piston_kinematics.py
